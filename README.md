# Indian Kids Screen Time Analysis
This project analyzes the screen time patterns among kids in India, exploring how factors like age, gender, device type, and location (urban vs rural) influence average daily screen usage. It also investigates health impacts and the ratio of educational vs recreational screen time using data analysis and visualization with Pandas and Matplotlib.
**Objectives**
1. Analyze average daily screen time by gender, device, and region.
2. Identify the percentage of kids exceeding the recommended limit.
3. Examine common health impacts of excessive screen usage.
4. Visualize findings with clean and interpretable charts for insights presentation.
